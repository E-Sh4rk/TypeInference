Can't express relations between variables

if (x,y) is Int*Int | Bool*Bool
then
	if x is Int then y
	else 0
else 0

Adding reducible expressions in the env can loose precision sometimes
(here, typing is more precise without the second if)

if z is Int*Int | Bool*Bool
then
	if snd z is Int | Bool
	then
		if fst z is Int
		then snd z
		else 0
	else 0
else 0

Adding reducible expressions in the env makes subject reduction false (but the type system seems still correct)

if (id id) 3 is Int then (id id) 3 else 0
with id: Any->Any
